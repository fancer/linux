ADS1000/ADS1100 (I2C)

This device is a 12-16 bit A-D converter with 1 input.

The inputs can be used either as a differential pair of Vin+ Vin- or as a single
ended sensor for Vin+ GND. The inputs mode is platform-dependent and isn't
configured by software in any case.

Device A-D converter sensitivity can be configured using two parameters:
 - pga is the programmable gain amplifier
    0: x1 (default) 
    1: x2
    2: x4
    3: x8
 - data_rate in samples per second also affecting the output code accuracy
    0: 128SPS - +/- Vdd*0.488mV (default, ads1000 accepts this rate only)
    1: 32SPS  - +/- Vdd*0.122mV
    2: 16SPS  - +/- Vdd*0.061mV
    3: 8SPS   - +/- Vdd*0.030mV
   Since this parameter also affects the output accuracy, be aware the greater
   SPS the worse accuracy.

As a result the output value is calculated by the next formulae:
dVin = Cod * Vdd / (PGA * max(|Cod|)), where
max(|Cod|) - maximum possible value of the output code, which depends on the SPS
setting from the table above.

The ADS1000/ADS1100 dts-node:

  Required properties:
   - compatible : must be "ti,ads1000" or "ti,ads1100"
   - reg : I2C bus address of the device
   - #address-cells : must be <1>
   - #size-cells : must be <0>
   - vdd-supply : regulator for reference supply voltage (usually fixed)

  Optional properties:
   - ti,gain : the programmable gain amplifier setting
   - ti,datarate : the converter data rate
   - ti,voltage-divider : <R1 R2> Ohms inbound voltage dividers,
     so dVin = (R1 + R2)/R2 * dVin

Example:

vdd_5v0: fixedregulator@0 {
	compatible = "regulator-fixed";
	regulator-name = "vdd-ref";
	regulator-min-microvolt = <5000000>;
	regulator-max-microvolt = <5000000>;
	regulator-always-on;
};

tiadc: ads1000@48 {
	compatible = "ti,ads1000";
	reg = <0x48>;

	vdd-supply = <&vdd_5v0>;
	ti,gain = <0>;
	ti,voltage-divider = <31600 3600>;
};
